## Green Paw Chefs: A Food Waste Awareness Game

This game is designed to educate and raise awareness about the importance of reducing food waste. Built with Flutter, it challenges players to manage a virtual restaurant, where they must carefully select ingredients, prepare dishes that cater to the diverse preferences of guests, and minimize waste. The game progresses through increasingly challenging levels, introducing various dietary restrictions, calorie-conscious meal planning, and an ingredient inventory management system.

- Calorie-Conscious Meal Planning: Balance guest satisfaction with calorie limits.
- Ingredient Inventory System: Manage your pantry to reduce waste and use ingredients before they expire.
- Progressive Difficulty: Levels increase in complexity, introducing guests with more complex dietary restrictions and preferences.
- Educational Content: Learn tips and facts about food sustainability, seasonal ingredients, and waste reduction.
- Unlockable Content: Achieve certain milestones to unlock new recipes, kitchen upgrades, and chef avatars.
